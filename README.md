## Approach
- Loaded UIDAI dataset using Python and Pandas
- Cleaned and processed date fields
- Calculated total population using age-group columns
- Performed district-wise aggregation

## Methodology
1. Data loading using Pandas
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Age-group based population calculation
4. District-wise summarization

## Tools Used
